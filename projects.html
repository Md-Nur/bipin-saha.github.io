    <div class="project">
        <h2>Behavioral Cloning of Self-Driving Car</h2>
        <img src="self_driving_car.jpg" alt="Behavioral Cloning Project Image">
        <p>Developed an End-to-End CNN and trained a model for planning trajectory at a hill road track. The average speed of the vehicle is around 10 MPH. Designed a PID controller module, which is responsible for maintaining trajectory stability.</p>

        <p>The tree is constructed incrementally from samples drawn randomly from the search space and is inherently biased to grow towards large unsearched areas of the problem.</p>

    <div class="project">
        <h2>Teleoperated Quadcopter for Aerial Mapping</h2>
        <img src="quadcopter_aerial_mapping.jpg" alt="Quadcopter Aerial Mapping Project Image">
        <p>Built a four-rotor quadcopter which provides 20 minutes of flight time. The project’s purpose was aerial mapping. Omnidirectional control range – 10KM. IMU, and GPS provide hovering stability. Grid mapping is used for path planning.</p>
